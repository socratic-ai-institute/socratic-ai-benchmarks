## 🚨 Critical Pre-Deployment Questions {#critical-questions}

### **MUST ANSWER BEFORE PROCEEDING**

#### 1. Research Compliance (BLOCKING)
- [ ] **IRB Approval**: Do you have IRB approval for research with minors? (Status: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Consent Process**: What parental consent is required? (Digital/paper?)
- [ ] **Data Retention**: How long must data be stored? (30 days? 7 years?)
- [ ] **Privacy Compliance**: FERPA/COPPA requirements? Can you collect GPS from minors?
- [ ] **Right to Deletion**: Must support student data deletion requests?

**Impact**: Cannot collect ANY pilot data without IRB approval. Plan 4-8 weeks for IRB process.

**Action Required**: Submit IRB protocol NOW or confirm approval status.

---

#### 2. Content Production (BLOCKING)
- [ ] **Audio Content**: Does 10-minute Richmond/Tredegar audio narration exist? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Text Version**: Is synchronized transcript available? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Rights**: Who owns content rights? Any licensing needed?
- [ ] **Quality**: Has content been reviewed by history educator? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Segmentation**: Are 2.5-minute breakpoints defined? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)

**Impact**: Zero sessions can run without content. This is your core experimental material.

**Action Required**:
- If exists: Validate quality with 5 test students
- If not: Commission production ASAP (budget: $2K-5K, timeline: 2-4 weeks)

---

#### 3. Assessment Design (BLOCKING)
- [ ] **Comprehension Test**: Do you have baseline/final assessments? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Validation**: Are tests piloted and validated? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Scoring**: Multiple choice (auto-scored) or open-ended (human grading)?
- [ ] **Reliability**: Inter-rater reliability target? (0.80+?)
- [ ] **Parallel Forms**: Are baseline and final equivalent but different?

**Impact**: Cannot measure "learning gains" without valid assessments. Research conclusions depend on this.

**Action Required**:
- Design 15-question assessment (5-minute completion time)
- Pilot with 20 students to validate difficulty and discrimination
- Establish scoring rubric if open-ended

---

#### 4. Location Access (HIGH RISK)
- [ ] **Tredegar Permission**: Do you have written agreement to conduct research on-site? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Lost Office**: Confirmed access to learning space? (Contact: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Schools**: Which Richmond schools are partners? (List: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **WiFi**: Verified connectivity at all locations? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Supervision**: Who monitors students at each location?

**Impact**: On-site location is KEY experimental manipulation. Without access, study design collapses.

**Action Required**:
- Secure written agreements with all location partners
- Test WiFi speed/reliability (need 5+ Mbps for audio streaming)
- Identify backup locations for each site

---

#### 5. Sample Size & Recruitment (PLANNING)
- [ ] **Target N per condition**: 5? 10? 20? (Decision: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Total participants**: 24 conditions × N = \_\_\_\_ students
- [ ] **Age range**: 14-18? Narrower? (Decision: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Recruitment plan**: Schools? Community centers? How?
- [ ] **Incentives**: Payment? Course credit? Amount: $\_\_\_\_

**Impact**: Affects statistical power, budget, timeline, and infrastructure scaling.

**Action Required**:
- Run power analysis for target effect size (Cohen's d = 0.4-0.5)
- Recommend: Start with 5-10 per condition (120-240 total) for pilot
- Plan for 20% attrition (oversample)

---

#### 6. AI Model Selection (COST/QUALITY TRADEOFF)
- [ ] **Budget for AI**: Can you afford $150-250 for pilot? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Latency tolerance**: Is 2-3 seconds per question acceptable? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)
- [ ] **Quality bar**: Must questions be perfect or "good enough"?
- [ ] **Fallback strategy**: Acceptable to use static questions if AI fails? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)

**Impact**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet = best quality, ~$0.02/question. Haiku = faster/cheaper, lower quality.

**Action Required**:
- Recommendation: Claude 3.5 Sonnet for pilot (240 students × 12 questions = $58)
- Use prompt caching to reduce costs 60-70%
- Build fallback to static questions if timeout

---

#### 7. Platform Technology (AFFECTS ALL DEVELOPMENT)
- [ ] **Device strategy**: School-provided iPads? BYOD? Laptops?
- [ ] **Platform preference**: Mobile app? Web app? Both?
- [ ] **Browser support**: Chrome only? Safari + Firefox?
- [ ] **Offline mode**: Required for locations with spotty WiFi? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)

**Impact**: Determines development timeline and complexity.

**Action Required**:
- **Recommendation**: Progressive Web App (PWA)
  - Works on ALL devices (phones, tablets, laptops)
  - GPS access for location verification
  - No app store approval delays
  - 8-10 week development timeline

---

#### 8. Budget & Timeline Constraints
- [ ] **Total budget available**: $\_\_\_\_\_
- [ ] **Funding source**: Grant? Department? University?
- [ ] **Hard deadline**: Must launch by \_\_\_\_\_? (Y/N)
- [ ] **Development resources**: Can you hire 1 FT developer for 4 months? (Y/N: \_\_\_\_)

**Impact**: Determines scope and phasing.

**Action Required**:
- Secure $48K-52K total budget (see detailed breakdown below)
- Confirm 16-20 week timeline acceptable
- If faster needed, consider reducing to 12 conditions (2 locations × 3 intervals × 2 types)

### **Data Flow Example: Dynamic Intervention**

```
1. Student reaches 2.5-minute mark in content
   ↓
2. Frontend sends POST /sessions/{id}/intervention
   ↓
3. API Gateway → Lambda (interventionHandler)
   ↓
4. Lambda retrieves:
   - Session context from DynamoDB
   - Student profile
   - Content segment metadata
   - Previous answers (if Q2 or Q3)
   ↓
5. Lambda calls Bedrock with prompt:
   - System: "You are a Socratic tutor for a 16yo..."
   - Context: "Student is AT Tredegar Iron Works..."
   - Previous: "Q1: [question], A1: [answer]"
   - Task: "Generate Q2 that builds on A1..."
   ↓
6. Bedrock streams response → Lambda buffers → returns
   ↓
7. Lambda saves intervention to DynamoDB:
   - Question text
   - Generation time
   - Tokens used
   - Timestamp
   ↓
8. Frontend displays question, collects answer
   ↓
9. Answer sent to POST /sessions/{id}/intervention/answer
   ↓
10. Saved to DynamoDB, triggers DynamoDB Stream
   ↓
11. Stream → Lambda → AppSync mutation
   ↓
12. Dashboard receives real-time update (WebSocket)
```

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation Plan {#risks}

### **Risk Matrix**

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **IRB delays** | Medium | Critical | Submit early, follow templates | Delay timeline, parallel dev work |
| **AI latency >5s** | Medium | High | Prompt caching, streaming | Fallback to static questions |
| **Location access revoked** | Low | High | Written agreements, backup sites | Move to backup location |
| **Data loss** | Low | Critical | PITR, backups, client buffering | Restore from backup, re-run sessions |
| **Cost overrun** | Medium | Medium | Real-time monitoring, alerts | Switch to cheaper AI model, cap sessions |
| **Recruitment failure** | Medium | High | Multiple channels, incentives | Extend timeline, reduce sample size |
| **Assessment invalidity** | Medium | Critical | Pilot testing, expert review | Redesign assessment, retest |
| **Condition contamination** | Medium | High | Individual sessions, instruct silence | Statistical control, exclude contaminated |
