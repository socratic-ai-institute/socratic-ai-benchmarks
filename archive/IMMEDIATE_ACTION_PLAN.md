- [ ] Audio recording (professional narration OR text-to-speech)
- [ ] Text transcript with timestamps

**Timeline**: 5-7 days
**Cost**: $0 (DIY script) to $500 (professional narrator)

**Resources**:
- Tredegar history: americancivilwarmuseum.org
- Richmond history: Library of Virginia
- UR history faculty for fact-checking

---

#### **Task 2: Design Comprehension Assessments**
**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL (blocks research validity)

**What to Create**: TWO parallel assessments (baseline + final)

**Baseline Assessment** (administered BEFORE content):
- 15 multiple-choice questions
- 5-minute completion time
- Topics: Richmond history, Tredegar, Civil War, industrialization
- Difficulty: Mix of recall, comprehension, analysis
- Purpose: Establish prior knowledge baseline

**Final Assessment** (administered AFTER content + interventions):
- 15 multiple-choice questions (parallel form)
- Same topics, different questions
- Same difficulty distribution
- Purpose: Measure learning gains

**Assessment Design Principles**:
```
Question Distribution:
- 5 questions: Factual recall (e.g., "When was Tredegar founded?")
- 5 questions: Conceptual understanding (e.g., "Why was Richmond strategic?")
- 5 questions: Application/analysis (e.g., "How did labor change after war?")

Difficulty:
- 5 easy (>70% expected correct)
- 7 medium (40-70% expected correct)
- 3 hard (<40% expected correct)
```

**Pilot Testing** (CRITICAL):
- Recruit 20 students (NOT from main study)
- Administer both assessments (1 week apart)
- Analyze item difficulty and discrimination
- Calculate test-retest reliability (target: r > 0.70)
- Revise questions based on results

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Baseline assessment (15 MC questions)
- [ ] Final assessment (15 MC questions, parallel form)
- [ ] Answer keys with explanations
- [ ] Pilot test results (item analysis)
- [ ] Reliability statistics

**Timeline**: 7-10 days (including pilot)
**Cost**: $300-600 (pilot student incentives: 20 √ó $15-30)

**Template Example**:
```
Question 1 (Recall, Easy):
When was Tredegar Iron Works founded?
A) 1807
B) 1837 ‚úì
C) 1867
D) 1897

Question 8 (Conceptual, Medium):
Why was Richmond's location important for Tredegar's success?
A) Proximity to coal deposits
B) Access to James River for transportation ‚úì
C) Large immigrant labor pool
D) Federal government contracts

Question 15 (Analysis, Hard):
How did the nature of labor at Tredegar change between 1850 and 1880?
A) From enslaved to free wage workers ‚úì
B) From skilled to unskilled workers
C) From local to immigrant workers
D) From male to female workers
```

### **Week 1-2: IRB & Compliance (YOU WILL RESEARCH)**

#### **Task 3: Research UR IRB Process**
**Priority**: üî¥ CRITICAL (blocks all student recruitment)

**What to Research**:
1. **UR IRB contact info**: Who handles student research protocols?
2. **Timeline**: How long from submission to approval? (typically 2-8 weeks)
3. **Requirements**: What forms, training, documentation needed?
4. **Exemption possibility**: Could this qualify as "educational research" exemption?
5. **Parental consent**: Required for students under 18?

**Action Steps**:
- [ ] Contact UR IRB office (irb@richmond.edu or equivalent)
- [ ] Request IRB application template
- [ ] Check if CITI training required (online research ethics course)
- [ ] Understand review timeline (full board vs expedited vs exempt)
- [ ] Identify faculty sponsor if you're a student researcher

**Key IRB Concerns for This Study**:
- ‚úÖ **Minimal risk**: Educational intervention, no physical/psychological harm
- ‚úÖ **Voluntary**: Students can opt out anytime
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minors**: May need parental consent if <18
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Data privacy**: GPS location data = personally identifiable
- ‚úÖ **Educational benefit**: Learning intervention (not just data collection)

**Strategy**:
- Aim for **"exempt" or "expedited" review** (faster than full board)
- Frame as "educational technology evaluation" not "experiment"
- Emphasize minimal risk, voluntary, and educational value
- Offer to share results with school (benefits UR)

**Timeline**: Research = 2-3 days, Submission = 1 week, Approval = 2-8 weeks

---

### **Week 2: Sample Size & Power Analysis**

#### **Task 4: Determine Target N per Condition**
**Priority**: üü° HIGH (affects budget, timeline, recruitment)

**What to Calculate**:
Using statistical power analysis, determine minimum N needed to detect effect.

**Parameters**:
- **Effect size**: Cohen's d = 0.4-0.5 (medium effect, realistic for educational interventions)
- **Power**: 1-Œ≤ = 0.80 (80% chance of detecting effect if it exists)
- **Alpha**: Œ± = 0.05 (5% false positive rate)
- **Design**: 4√ó3√ó2 factorial ANOVA with 24 conditions

**Quick Estimate**:
```
For Cohen's d = 0.4, power = 0.80, Œ± = 0.05:
- N per condition = 8-12 students
- Total N = 24 conditions √ó 10 students = 240 students

With 20% attrition:
- Recruit: 240 √ó 1.2 = 288 students
```

**Recommendation**: Start with **5-10 per condition for pilot** (120-240 total)

**Tools**:
- G*Power (free software): https://www.psychologie.hhu.de/arbeitsgruppen/allgemeine-psychologie-und-arbeitspsychologie/gpower
- Online calculator: https://www.statmethods.net/stats/power.html
- R package: `pwr`

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Power analysis report
- [ ] Justification for sample size
- [ ] Budget impact (N √ó $30 incentive)
- [ ] Timeline impact (recruitment strategy)

**Timeline**: 1-2 days
**Cost**: $0 (use free software)

### **Week 2-3: Location Partnerships**

#### **Task 5: Secure All 4 Locations**
**Priority**: üü° HIGH (blocks location-based experimental conditions)

**Status**:
- ‚úÖ **Classroom (UR)**: You confirmed UR will be used
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **On-site (Tredegar)**: Need to secure access
- ‚ùì **Learning Space**: Need to identify (Lost Office or alternative)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Home**: Self-reported (no partnership needed)

**Action Steps**:

**1. Classroom at UR**:
- [ ] Identify specific classroom (need WiFi, quiet, 1-hour blocks)
- [ ] Reserve room for data collection period (coordinate with registrar)
- [ ] Test WiFi speed (need ‚â•5 Mbps for audio streaming)
- [ ] Create supervision plan (who monitors students?)

**2. On-Site at Tredegar Iron Works**:
- [ ] Contact: American Civil War Museum (acwm.org, 804-649-1861)
- [ ] Request: Permission for educational research on-site
- [ ] Logistics: WiFi availability? Quiet space? Supervision?
- [ ] Backup: If denied, pivot to "video of on-site" condition

**3. Learning Space**:
- [ ] Option A: Lost Office Collaborative (if available)
- [ ] Option B: UR library study room
- [ ] Option C: UR makerspace or innovation lab
- [ ] Requirement: WiFi, quiet, distinct from classroom

**4. Home**:
- [ ] No partnership needed
- [ ] Students self-report and complete from home
- [ ] Verify via network SSID (not school WiFi) + honor system

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Written agreements (email confirmations acceptable)
- [ ] Location logistics plan (WiFi, supervision, scheduling)
- [ ] Backup locations identified

**Timeline**: 7-10 days
**Cost**: $0-500 (potential location fees)
