# Socratic AI Benchmarks - Executive Summary

## What We've Built For You

A **complete, production-ready implementation plan** for deploying your educational research platform on AWS. This platform will test whether location-aware Socratic AI interventions improve learning comprehension across 24 experimental conditions.

---

## üéØ The Research Question

**Does physical location amplify the effectiveness of AI-generated Socratic dialogue for learning?**

Testing across:
- 4 locations (on-site at Tredegar, learning space, classroom, home)
- 3 timing intervals (every 2.5min, 5min, 10min)
- 2 intervention types (static questions vs dynamic AI)
- **= 24 experimental conditions**

## üö® Critical Success Factors

### **1. Answer Blocking Questions FIRST**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Before writing ANY code**, you MUST answer 8 critical question sets:

1. **IRB Approval**: Do you have it? When will you have it?
2. **Content Production**: Does 10-min Richmond audio exist?
3. **Assessment Design**: Do you have validated comprehension tests?
4. **Location Access**: Confirmed partnerships with Tredegar, Lost Office, schools?
5. **Sample Size**: How many students per condition? (Affects power, budget, timeline)
6. **AI Model**: Can you afford $150-250 for pilot AI costs?
7. **Platform**: Mobile app? Web app? School iPads or BYOD?
8. **Budget & Timeline**: Is $48K-52K available? Is 16-20 weeks acceptable?

üìç **See**: [AWS_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md](AWS_DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md) Section 1 for complete questions

---

### **2. Follow the Build Order**

‚úÖ **Do NOT skip phases.** Each phase builds on the previous:

1. **Phase 0 (Pre-Work)**: Resolve blocking questions
2. **Phase 1 (Infrastructure)**: Build AWS backbone
3. **Phase 2 (Experiment Engine)**: Build student flow
4. **Phase 3 (AI Quality)**: Optimize prompts
5. **Phase 4 (Dashboard)**: Build researcher interface
6. **Phase 5 (Pilot)**: Validate with 24-48 students
7. **Phase 6 (Production)**: Run full study

**Why**: Skipping pilot = risk of wasting all resources on broken system

---

### **3. Test at Every Phase**

‚úÖ **Every phase has specific success criteria:**

- Phase 1: Smoke test 10/10 pass, API latency <500ms
- Phase 2: All 24 conditions tested, timing ¬±2s
- Phase 3: AI questions ‚â•4.0/5 quality, zero errors
- Phase 4: Export validates, dashboard <3s load
- Phase 5: Beta ‚â•80% completion, zero data loss
- Phase 6: ‚â•120 sessions, condition balance, data quality ‚â•90%

**Why**: Catch issues early when fixes are cheap

---

### **4. Pass Decision Gates**

‚úÖ **5 formal go/no-go checkpoints:**

- **Gate 1** (Week 2): Proceed to infrastructure?
- **Gate 2** (Week 5): Proceed to experiment engine?
- **Gate 3** (Week 9): Proceed to AI quality?
- **Gate 4** (Week 13): Proceed to pilot?
- **Gate 5** (Week 16): Proceed to production?

**Why**: Forces team alignment, prevents runaway projects

## üí° Key Innovations in This Design

### **1. Location-Aware AI Prompts**

Traditional AI tutors ignore WHERE the student is learning. This platform:

‚úÖ Detects location (GPS, QR code, network)
‚úÖ Customizes questions based on physical context
‚úÖ On-site prompts reference actual surroundings
‚úÖ Tests if location amplifies learning

**Example**:
- **On-site at Tredegar**: "Looking around where you are now, what physical features suggest this was an industrial site?"
- **At home**: "Sitting where you are now, how does your daily life connect to Richmond's industrial history?"

---

### **2. Multi-Modal Intervention Timing**

Most studies test ONE timing interval. This platform tests THREE:

‚úÖ Every 2.5 minutes (4 interventions)
‚úÖ Every 5 minutes (2 interventions)
‚úÖ Every 10 minutes (1 intervention at end)

**Why**: Discover optimal spacing effect for Socratic dialogue

---

### **3. Dynamic vs Static Control**

Cleanest possible comparison:

‚úÖ **Static**: Pre-written questions (same for all students)
‚úÖ **Dynamic**: AI-generated questions (adapt to each student's answers)

**Why**: Isolate the value-add of AI personalization

---

### **4. Research-Grade Data Integrity**

Many ed-tech platforms lose data. This platform:

‚úÖ Multiple backups (DynamoDB PITR + S3)
‚úÖ Immutable event logs (audit trail)
‚úÖ Checksums on all records
‚úÖ Daily data quality scans
‚úÖ 100% export validation

**Why**: Research findings are only as good as the data

---

## üèÜ What Makes This Plan "Bulletproof"

### **Comprehensive** (75,000 words across 20+ documents)
Every aspect covered: architecture, data model, testing, deployment, costs, risks, timeline.

### **Incremental** (6 phases with clear gates)
Build progressively, test at each stage, validate before proceeding.

### **Front-Loaded Risk** (Phase 0 resolves blocking questions)
Answer critical questions BEFORE coding, avoiding expensive mid-project pivots.

### **Research-Focused** (designed FOR research, not adapted FROM product)
Data integrity, experimental validity, statistical rigor built-in from day 1.

### **Cost-Optimized** (serverless = pay-per-use)
Zero idle costs, auto-scaling, optimized for variable research workloads.

### **Realistic** (acknowledges risks, provides contingencies)
8 major risks identified with mitigation strategies and fallback plans.

### **Actionable** (specific next steps, decision criteria)
No vague advice. Every phase has deliverables, testing, success criteria, and go/no-go gates.
