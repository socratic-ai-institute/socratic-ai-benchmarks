   - Query: Filter by interval field

3. **Is dynamic AI better than static questions?**
   - Compare AI-generated vs pre-written interventions
   - Query: [SCHEMA_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](SCHEMA_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) - GSI4 (by intervention type)

4. **What are interaction effects?**
   - Full 4√ó3√ó2 factorial ANOVA
   - Query: [SCHEMA_QUICK_REFERENCE.md](SCHEMA_QUICK_REFERENCE.md) - GSI1 (all 24 conditions)

5. **Does on-site amplify dynamic AI?**
   - 2√ó2 interaction: location √ó intervention type
   - Query: Custom DynamoDB scan with filters

---

## üèÜ What Makes This Implementation Bulletproof

### **1. Front-Loaded Risk Mitigation**

‚úÖ **Phase 0 (Pre-Work)** addresses ALL blocking questions before coding
- IRB approval process started
- Content validated
- Assessments piloted
- Locations secured
- Budget approved

**Why**: Avoids costly mid-project pivots

---

### **2. Incremental Testing at Each Phase**

‚úÖ Every phase has **clear deliverables + testing + decision gate**
- Phase 1: Infrastructure smoke test (10/10 success)
- Phase 2: All 24 conditions tested
- Phase 3: AI quality expert review (‚â•4.0/5)
- Phase 4: Dashboard validates with 1K sessions
- Phase 5: Pilot with real students (‚â•80% completion)

**Why**: Catches issues early, validates before proceeding

---

### **3. Comprehensive Documentation**

‚úÖ **75,000 words** across 20+ documents covering:
- Architecture (AWS, data, frontend)
- Implementation (code examples, step-by-step)
- Testing (strategy, tools, success criteria)
- Operations (monitoring, costs, risks)

**Why**: Any developer can pick up and continue work

---

### **4. Research-Grade Data Integrity**

‚úÖ **Multiple layers of validation**:
- DynamoDB point-in-time recovery (35 days)
- Immutable event log (DynamoDB Streams ‚Üí S3)
- Checksums on all critical records
- Daily data quality scans
- Export validation (100% accuracy)

**Why**: Research findings depend on data quality

---

### **5. Cost Optimization Built-In**

‚úÖ **Serverless architecture** = pay only for what you use
- Lambda: Zero idle costs
- DynamoDB: Auto-scaling
- Bedrock: Per-token pricing + caching (60% savings)
- CloudFront: Compression + price class optimization

**Why**: Research budgets are limited, must optimize

---

### **6. Clear Decision Gates**

‚úÖ **5 formal go/no-go checkpoints**:
- Gate 1: Proceed to infrastructure?
- Gate 2: Proceed to experiment engine?
- Gate 3: Proceed to AI quality?
- Gate 4: Proceed to pilot?
- Gate 5: Proceed to production?

**Why**: Forces team alignment, prevents runaway projects
